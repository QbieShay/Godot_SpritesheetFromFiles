You can export a sequence of png files (with blender, for example) an merge all into a single png.

### How to use?

1. Press the "Select Files" Button. Browse your project and select all pngs you want.
1. Configure your grid with the options of the right of the tool: with of each frame, height and number of frames per row.
1. Press the "Process" Button and select a File.

Your file will be created instantly.

### Thats all!
